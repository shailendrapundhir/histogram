How to run:

This project is created in Intellij IDEA. In order to run, clone the repo on your machine.
Edit run configurations, in program arguments ,add complete file path which contains values listed.
When run, the program will output the result in run window.

Note:
Values in file must be separated by lines.

EDIT:

Now the program accepts input file path using standard input. So we can take the source code and compile it using any standard Java 8 compiler.
